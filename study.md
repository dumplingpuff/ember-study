## Why use Ember

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
Ember is a MVC javascript framework and is similar to Ruby on Rails. Similar to
rails Ember tries to implement convention over configuration so this means that
the framework has a lot of built in functions and choices that make it easy
to understand and implement.  The pros of such a framework is that it is easy
for beginners to dive into, less prone to mistakes made by the user, more
readable, and the ease of fast website building. Some who are more experienced
in the field would argue the lack of freedom in choice when developing.

I was listening to the podcast called Real World Ember and they discussed what
it is good about getting started with Ember. The Ember CLI which is the command
line tool for Ember is great because it does everything for you.  It installs
all the dependencies you need for you and is very easy to generate templates and
models. The CLI also makes it easy for beginners to not choose which build
package and it makes it easy to add and understand ES6 stuff about modules.
These types of small decisions can take a long time decide and Ember takes that
choice away by already including a lot of the tools and this allows the user to
start building almost right on the spot.

 The problem with CLI is that sometimes it might be difficult to add
developer dependencies if you don't know what the CLI is doing exactly. When
swapping dependencies you always have to do it through the system.

Also they said Ember is really great for introducing someone to testing because
Ember uses testing at its core. Ember is included with three
different types of tests: Acceptance, Unit, and Integration.

Ember also does a really good job of developing the use of handlebars into its
framework. It uses data binding in conjunction with handlebars to generate html
easily and in an organzied structure. One example is that in the index . Then it
 takes it to another level that we haven't used before where
you can use handlebars to link the page to another route.
